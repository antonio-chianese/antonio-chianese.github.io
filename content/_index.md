Heyo! SeniorMars here. It's honestly weird to think that people will spend their time reading things I wrote ( I'm usually on the other side), but I'm hope you enjoy your stay here. You can learn more about me [here](/about) or explore the links up top. Frankly, I'm not sure what I want to make this site about - I like a lot of things, so I guess we'll see where this goes. In either case, this is a blog about math, extremely niche interests, and a guy having fun!
